# Notice
This requires an Exploit. An exploit is a bannable offence and should not be done. Everything here is done for Archival pourposes. 

With that being said, do not use this unless you are: 
- A historian
- Data Collector
- Or some other that can find use of this.

# Update Log
`0.0.1b`
- Fixed error
