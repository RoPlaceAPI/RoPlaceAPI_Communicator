# Scratch everything here
[The better Option](https://gist.github.com/yafyz/df12d858fcc7a62df1ff25dce851e34b)

Props to this man for basically making this useless. I was gonna take it for a learning experience but alright man.

# Loadstring
```lua
getfenv().logToConsole = true -- Set to false if your exploit doesn't have rconsoleprint but supports filesystem.

loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoPlaceAPI/RoPlaceAPI_DataCollector/main/src/main.lua"))()
```

# Notice
This requires an Exploit. An exploit is a bannable offence and should not be done. Everything here is done for Archival pourposes. 

With that being said, do not use this unless you are: 
- A historian
- Data Collector
- Or some other that can find use of this.

# Update Log
`0.0.2b`
- Added check for `rconsoleprint()`
- Added Toggle for logToConsole
