# Loadstring
```lua
getfenv().logToConsole = true -- Set to false if your exploit doesn't have rconsoleprint but supports filesystem.

# Notice
This requires an Exploit. An exploit is a bannable offence and should not be done. Everything here is done for Archival pourposes. 

With that being said, do not use this unless you are: 
- A historian
- Data Collector
- Or some other that can find use of this.

# Update Log
`0.1.0a`
- Console logs out to CSV.
- Various Changes
